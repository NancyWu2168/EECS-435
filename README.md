The final project of EECS 435 in Northwestern

# Background
As known, Japanese and Norway are the two major countries in the whaling industry. Japanese whaling incredibly began in the Jomon period[1] (the first 131st century - the first 4th century), which was considered as the significant part of fisheries. After the International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling, Japan’s massive commercial whaling in the 20th century ended[2].But after centuries of intense whaling, recovering whale populations still have a hard time adapting to warming oceans and struggle to compete every day with the industrial fishing industry for food.

To aid whale conservation efforts, scientists use photo surveillance systems to monitor ocean activity. They use the shape of whales’ tails and unique markings found in footage to identify what species of whale they’re analyzing and meticulously log whale pod dynamics and movements. For the past 40 years, most of this work has been done manually by individual scientists, leaving a huge trove of data untapped and underutilized.  There lies the problem that effective and precise identification is able to lead to a better compact on both whale conservation and natural regulation. To be more specific, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified Minke whales as a “non-hazardou” species but the fin whale as an endangered species such that identification could be regarded as the important aid of whale conservation by avoid from waste on resources and finance.

In this project, we plan to use the whale tails to predict the classes of that whale. Not only does this method help scientists survive the whales but also a good way to record the whale activity. Tourists can upload the photo on the website they took by chance and get what does this whale belong to. This AI method is a new applications in many aspects.
